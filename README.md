# Mini-projects
# Project One - Background color selector.

This repository contains basic projects to understand DOM manipulation and event handling.
This is a beginner-friendly Background Color Changer project created as a warm-up exercise to practice core web development concepts. The project allows users to change the background color dynamically using JavaScript, making it a fun and interactive way to understand how the DOM works.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals, especially DOM manipulation and event handling. It demonstrates how JavaScript can interact with HTML elements and modify styles in real-time based on user actions.

1. Features

Change the background color dynamically with a button click

Selected color generation 

Simple and clean user interface

Beginner-friendly code structure

Real-time UI updates without page reload

2. Tech Stack

HTML – For the basic structure of the webpage

CSS – For styling the layout and UI

JavaScript – For handling events and changing background colors dynamically

# Project Two - BMI Calculator.

This BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a beginner-friendly project created to practice core programming concepts such as user input handling, mathematical calculations, and conditional logic. The application allows users to enter their height and weight, calculates their BMI using the standard formula, and displays both the numeric BMI value and the corresponding health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).
1. Features

Accepts user input for height and weight

Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) using the standard formula

Displays the BMI value with proper formatting

Classifies BMI into categories:

Underweight

Normal weight

Overweight

Validates user input (prevents empty or invalid values)

Simple and beginner-friendly user interface

2. Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure of the application

CSS – Styling and layout design

JavaScript – Logic for BMI calculation and DOM manipulation

The project is designed to be simple, easy to understand, and beginner-focused, making it a great example of applying basic programming logic to a real-world problem. It can be used as a learning exercise for understanding formulas, conditional statements, and basic user interface design.
