# Warmup-projects
# Project One - Background color selector.

This repository contains basic projects to understand DOM manipulation and event handling.
This is a beginner-friendly Background Color Changer project created as a warm-up exercise to practice core web development concepts. The project allows users to change the background color dynamically using JavaScript, making it a fun and interactive way to understand how the DOM works.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals, especially DOM manipulation and event handling. It demonstrates how JavaScript can interact with HTML elements and modify styles in real-time based on user actions.
