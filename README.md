# Mini-projects
# Project One - Background color selector.

This repository contains basic projects to understand DOM manipulation and event handling.
This is a beginner-friendly Background Color Changer project created as a warm-up exercise to practice core web development concepts. The project allows users to change the background color dynamically using JavaScript, making it a fun and interactive way to understand how the DOM works.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals, especially DOM manipulation and event handling. It demonstrates how JavaScript can interact with HTML elements and modify styles in real-time based on user actions.

# Project Two - BMI Calculator.

This BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a beginner-friendly project created to practice core programming concepts such as user input handling, mathematical calculations, and conditional logic. The application allows users to enter their height and weight, calculates their BMI using the standard formula, and displays both the numeric BMI value and the corresponding health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).

The project is designed to be simple, easy to understand, and beginner-focused, making it a great example of applying basic programming logic to a real-world problem. It can be used as a learning exercise for understanding formulas, conditional statements, and basic user interface design (if web-based).
